									When searching for a car, there are several factors to consider. The factor that I find the most important when choosing a new car is the MPG that the car has. A large MPG ultimately save money for the user because you would have to refuel less often. The next most important factor is the appearance of the car. A vehicle can be the most technological piece of equipment on the market but, if it does not look as good as it performs the utility is lost. The final factor is the price of the car. Again, a car can be the greatest in every feature but, if you can't afford it there is no point.

										The following pages contain my top three dream cars followed by their features.
