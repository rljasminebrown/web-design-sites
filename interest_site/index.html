			<p>Welcome to my interest website! This website includes my top picks for Bands, Hobbies, and Vacation Spots. In general, I enjoy music in the alternative genre and hobbies that don't include me moving much. Someday, I'd like to revisit Europe but, until then I'll have to stick with pictures online. If you have any information about the subsequent pages feel free to <a href ="mailto:jasmine.brown@kmhsmagnet.com?subject=Website Feedback">contact me</a>!
