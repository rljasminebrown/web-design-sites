				I have always loved traveling, especially to places outside of the country. Both the natural grandeur of the location and historical structure of the cities are what draws me in the most. Below, are my two favorite European countries that I have visited in the past, on that I spent six weeks in and the other that I spent 2 hours in.

				I’ve traveled quite a lot over the years, most of it is involuntary, and I have found that it can be liberating to visit new places. Of these places I’ve visited, one has stuck out the most. My favorite vacation place is the UK.

				My second favorite vacation that I have taken was also the shortest. On a tour around Europe, my family briefly stopped in Switzerland. We spent less than two hours there, but I immediately fell in love with the sight of the mountains and the coolness of the summer air. Switzerland officially called the Swiss Confederation, is home to some of the best-made dairy products in the world.
