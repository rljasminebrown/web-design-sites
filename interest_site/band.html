				Music is as natural to me as breathing or walking. I could listen to almost any genre and find something that resonated with me. I recently have started going to live shows with my first being the summer of my junior year. The following bands have personally influenced me into learning two instruments, the bass guitar and the ukulele.

				Much like the typical teenager, I enjoy music that my parents just can’t quite understand. My favorite band to date has to be Panic at the Disco. PTAD features music that ranges from upbeat pop-style songs to luxurious, velvety ballads. I like listening to PTAD because there is a song for every moment and every emotion. I recently received a PTAD record this past Christmas which I listen to often.

			Similar to Panic at the Disco is Twenty &Oslash;ne Pil&oslash;ts. This band bends the conventional when it comes to genre, containing everything from alternative hip-hop to radio-ready pop hits to gentle ukulele music. I also received a record from this band this past holiday season. I like listening to TOP because there is a song for every moment in every pseudo-genre.
